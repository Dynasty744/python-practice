# VARIABLE
# no need to use var/let/const like JS, just declare and initialize
# if a variable is an empty box, then
# declare means to create an empty box
# initialize means to put something in that empty box
#
# patient_name = 'Dynasty 744'
# patient_age = '20'
# new_patient = True
# print('We are checking in ' + patient_name + ', the patient is at the age of ' + patient_age + ', and he is a new patient')

# INPUT
#
# name = input("What is your name? ")
# print("Hello " + name)

# TYPE CONVERSION
#
# birth_yerar = input("Enter your birth year: ")
# current_age = 2024 - int(birth_yerar) # conversion here
# print(current_age)

# ADDITION CALCULATOR
# can also type covert at input
#
# first_number = input("Gimme the first number: ")
# second_number = input("Now gimme the second number: ")
# sum = float(first_number) + float(second_number)
# print("Sum: " + str(sum))

# STRINGS
#
# course = 'Python for Beginners'
# print(course.upper())
# print(course.find('y')) # .find(y) will return the index of the first occurence of 'y'
# print(course.find('for'))
# print(course.replace('for', '4'))
# print('Python' in course) # True
